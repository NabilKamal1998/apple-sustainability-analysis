## Introduction:

Apple has long been at the forefront of corporate sustainability, with a steadfast commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and pioneering innovative solutions. At the heart of this commitment lies Apple 2030, an ambitious pledge to achieve carbon neutrality for its entire footprint by the end of the decade. This entails a holistic approach to sustainability, encompassing every stage of the product lifecycle, from manufacturing processes to material sourcing.

In its Apple Environmental Progress Report 2024, the company outlines its sustainability goals and progress highlights. Among these goals is the aim to become carbon neutral for corporate operations, a milestone already achieved in 2020 through a combination of energy efficiency initiatives, renewable energy sourcing, and strategic investments in carbon offsetting measures.

Furthermore, Apple has set its sights on achieving carbon neutrality for its entire footprint by 2030, targeting a 75 percent reduction in related emissions compared to 2015 levels. Progress toward this goal is evident, with emissions reduced by over 55 percent across the value chain since 2015. Additionally, the company is actively transitioning its entire value chain to rely on 100 percent clean electricity by 2030, with a significant number of suppliers already committed to this transition.

While Apple's sustainability goals are ambitious and its progress commendable, the question remains: has the company truly reached these milestones as outlined in its reports? In this analysis, we delve into the data to scrutinize Apple's environmental performance, examining whether its stated goals have been met and assessing the efficacy of its sustainability initiatives.
